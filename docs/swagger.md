# Swagger

### Open API Docs

API Docs are generated using OpenAPI. Docs can be accessed by `/swagger` using the webinterface.

See [these docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=net-cli) on how to annotate your code.

> Use the web interface to try out or import the swagger file to postman.

> No need to manually develop against it: You can use NSwag Studio to generate class libraries for c#, typescript and many more.
